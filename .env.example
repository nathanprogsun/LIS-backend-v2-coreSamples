# This is an example .env file for the Docker Compose setup.
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values.
# Do NOT commit your actual .env file to version control.

# --- MySQL Credentials ---
# Root password for the MySQL container (used by Docker to initialize the DB)
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_VAL=myrootpassword_changeme

# Dedicated user and password for the CoreSamples application to connect to MySQL
MYSQL_USER_VAL=coresamples_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD_VAL=coresamples_pass_changeme

# Database name for the CoreSamples application
MYSQL_DATABASE_VAL=coresamples_db

# --- JWT Secret for CoreSamples service ---
# Replace with a strong, unique secret for JWT token generation
JWT_SECRET_VAL=thisisadevelopmentsecret_pleasedontuseinprod_changeme

# --- Optional: CoreSamples Service Configuration ---
# Log level for the CoreSamples service (e.g., debug, info, warn, error)
# CORESAMPLES_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Sentry DSN for error reporting (leave empty to disable)
# SENTRY_DSN_VAL=your_sentry_dsn_here

# --- Optional: Host Port Mappings ---
# If default host ports conflict with your local setup, you can change them here.
# The format is: DESIRED_HOST_PORT
# MYSQL_HOST_PORT=3307
# CONSUL_HOST_PORT=8500
# REDIS_HOST_PORT=6379
# JAEGER_AGENT_UDP_PORT=6831 # Host port for Jaeger agent UDP traffic
# JAEGER_UI_HOST_PORT=16686  # Host port for Jaeger UI

# --- Optional: Jaeger Configuration ---
# Log level for Jaeger (e.g., debug, info, error)
# JAEGER_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# --- Note on CoreSamples Application Code ---
# For this Docker Compose setup to work as intended (especially regarding DB and Redis connections),
# the CoreSamples Go application code needs to be adapted to:
# 1. Recognize the RUN_ENV=dev_docker_compose environment variable.
# 2. Prioritize environment variables (like MYSQL_HOST, REDIS_ADDR, JWT_SECRET_VAL) 
#    over fetching these configurations from Consul.
# 3. Connect to Redis as a standalone instance when in dev_docker_compose mode.
# 4. Handle Kafka unavailability gracefully (as Kafka is not included in this basic setup).
